## How I started
When starting this assignment, I was lost in how to approach this assignment. I understood the requirements of this assignment as what to add. However I felt uneasy of where to start.

I ultimatly started by going down the list, starting with adding Moment Js.

After this, I then added the time blocks without styling, just the HTML.

After adding the time blocks, I needed to add them to local storage, as I believe it would be best for timesake to do what I somewhat know how to tackle.

## My problems with the project
My first issue I ran into was that I still need to get used to JQuery, I am understanding how it works, however I still need time to adjust to the new terminology. 
The second issue that I ran into was that I needed to figure out how to grab my content, and id to make local storage work. Since this project is simple enough, now I am understanding localstorage more than before. Lastly, the issue that I have difficulty tackling is changing the time blocks color according to Moment.Js

## My thoughts about this project
I actually enjoyed this project alot. I felt as though during the module work, I wasn't grasping JQuery. However, working with this project, it forced me to think and do even more research. Normally with Javascript, I would spend hours researching and thinking about the code I am looking at and still not understanding it. Fortunatly, this project was simple, and I've learned alot from it.

## Anything I would update
I would most likely update this project by adding a feature to transition into darkmode. I understand this would add nothing to the functionality of the page, however I believe that It would look neat to add to a project like this.
